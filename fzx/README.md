# fzx

Sucessor of [jsfs](https://github.com/jjg/jsfs).  Part of the WebE project.

I'm not going to put much here for now. [The journal](../journal.md) is the best source of info at the moment.

## Usage

### Tests

`go test ./...`

### Run it!

`go build`
`./fzx`

### API

The API is based off [jsfs](https://github.com/jjg/jsfs#api).  It is nowhere near complete (again, see [the journal](../journal.md) for current status).
